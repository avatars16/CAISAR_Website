## Important questions

compare nondecompositional graphs
compare graph constans (less is better). Bottom is not a graph constant. Because we capture more generalizations.

## Thesis parts:

### Problem setting:

Look at the am tools hard coded stuff to find examples of how this parser improves

### appendix

-   NN details (hyperparameters, can be found in allennlp)
-   NN details (morpheme parser details)
-   corpus details (sentences, test train dev split, cite corpus. Look at previous paper for mor details).

# coding task:

Run config.json without pretrained word embeddings
Continue writing my own script

# Running the parser on the graph.

-   Setting up docker environment.
